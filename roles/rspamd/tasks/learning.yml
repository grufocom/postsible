      ========================================
      Rspamd Learning Setup Complete
      ========================================
      
      Learning Scripts:
      - /usr/local/bin/rspamd-scripts/learn-spam.sh
      - /usr/local/bin/rspamd-scripts/learn-ham.sh
      - /usr/local/bin/rspamd-scripts/learn-all.sh
      
      Cronjobs:
      - Spam learning: Every 30 minutes
      - Ham learning: Every 30 minutes
      - Full learning: Daily at 3:00 AM
      
      How it works:
      1. Users move spam to .Spam folder
      2. Users move false positives to .Ham folder
      3. Cronjobs automatically learn from these folders
      4. Bayes filter improves over time
      
      Manual learning:
      - Run: /usr/local/bin/rspamd-scripts/learn-all.sh
      
      Logs:
      - /var/log/rspamd-learning/spam.log
      - /var/log/rspamd-learning/ham.log
      - /var/log/rspamd-learning/daily.log
